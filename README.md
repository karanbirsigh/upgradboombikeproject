##Problem Statement

BoomBikes, a US bike-sharing provider, has seen a drop in revenue due to the pandemic and aims to recover post-lockdown. They’ve hired a consulting firm to identify key factors driving bike demand in the American market. The company wants to know:

- Which variables predict bike demand.
- How well these variables explain demand.

BoomBikes has gathered a dataset on daily bike rentals, considering various factors like weather and user behavior.

## Conclusions
We observe the following:

Bike rentals are lowest in spring, peak in summer, and are highest in fall.
Rentals increased in 2019 compared to 2018.
Data on heavy snow/rain weather is missing, which may affect analysis of extreme weather impacts.
Rentals peak in June, July , and September, with lower counts in January .
More rentals occur on working days and non-holidays.
Rental demand is consistent across weekdays.
"Clear Sky" weather correlates with higher rentals, while "Light snowy rain" correlates with lower rentals. "Heavy snowy
rain" does not occur.
Strong positive correlations exist between temperature (temp/atemp) and rentals.
Registered users have a stronger positive correlation with rentals than casual users.
Humidity and windspeed show weak correlations with rentals.
Rentals increase from March to June and decrease toward year-end.
